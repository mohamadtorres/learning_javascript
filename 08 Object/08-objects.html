        <h1>Object</h1>
        make codes more organised than<br>
        An Object groups multiple values together<br>
        Objects are created using curly braces {}<br>
        Objects can contain properties and methods<br>
        Properties are named data values that can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation<br>
        Methods are functions that can be called on objects<br>
        we can change the properties of an object using dot notation or bracket notation ===>         product.price = 1500<br>

        <h3>Two different ways to reach an element in an object</h3>
        console.log(product2.name) // to access a property in an object<br>
        console.log(product2['name']); // to access a property by Brqacket Notation

        <br>
        <h3>Why we use bracket Notation?</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes for example when u have: <br><br>
            console.log(product2.delivery-time) <br><br>
            it does not understand that the property is talking about an attribute called <em>delivery time</em>. it sees the "-" as a minus and it wants to subtract the time from Delivery which is wrong because you dont want to do it. So you put it in brackets to show this is a property. <br><br>
            console.log(product2['delivery-time']) // will work correctly
        </p>

        }

        console.log(product)
        console.log(product.name) // to access a property in an object
        console.log(product.description)
        console.log(product.price)
        product.price = 1500
        console.log(product.price)

        //a property that does not exist
        product.newProperty = true;
        console.log(product);

        delete product.newProperty; // delete a property
        console.log(product);

            name: "Phone",
